# Antistasi Extender Example
This is an example of how you could extend Antistasi with new maps or templates or overwrite existing ones.

# Requirements
  - Arma 3
  - Arma 3 Tools  
    
  Both need to be run once from steam.

# How to get started:
- Run the `Install.ps1` script and follow the instructions on screen.
- Run the `Build.ps1` script. This will create a folder in the root folder called build and compile your extension into it.
- Start the ArmA 3 launcher and in the launcher do the following:
  1) Under `Mods` -> `...More` select `add watched folder...` then `add custom folder...`.
      Navigate to your extensions root folder and select the newly created build folder.
      If successful it will have added that folder in the list of watched folders and a green box would have shown
      stating that a mod has been installed.

  2) Load `Antistasi - The Mod` and the newly installed `A3 Antistasi Extender example` mods.
  3) Start the game and confirm that the new template and/or map is loaded by starting a local host session under multiplayer
      and confirming that the new map and overwritten map is there. Then start a game of antistasi and confirm that the
      new and overwritten templates are there (these are the example maps and templates provided with the extender).

      The new maps names start with `Antistasi Altis Extender` and the new templates are `CSAT` and `CSAT2`.

  Assuming everything went well you are now ready to make your own modifications.
  Remember to remove unused content and read thoroughly through the files while making any edits.
  As a hint all content is added from the config.cpp files located within each of the addons so you can follow that down to the files that govern the different parts like templates and maps etc.


# Example additions
## Maps
Antistasi now supports 3rd party map porting.

There are two examples added for working with maps. Adding a new map and overwriting/applying additions for an existing map.

  In this examples there are also demonstrations of mission specific overwrites of `mapInfo` and `navGrid` data as well as global overwrite/addition.

  You will find all the information regarding this under `your extension mod/addons/maps`.

  Take care to study all the files in the addon to not miss crucial porting steps.

## Templates
Antistasi now supports 3rd party template additions/overwrites.

  To add new templates or overwrite existing ones follow the demonstration given in `your extension mod/addons/templates/Templates/Templates.hpp`.

  Note that while you can add addon vehicle templates to Antistasi at this time, it should be noted that it is still a limited system and you shouldn't expect full functionality from them atm.

  Again it's important to read through all the files in the `templates` addon to not miss important steps.

## Functionality
- Antistasi now has events that you can listen to and extend existing functionality.
  A list of all events and their parameters can be found in the in game config under: `A3A >> Events`.
- In addition you can overwrite any of Antistasi's functions to add, change or remove functionality. This includes full systems (be aware that this is more complex and can break on updates).
  To do so, simply add a function to the `A3A` class of `CfgFunctions.hpp` under the addon functions (you can also replicate the config.cpp to allow this in any other addon).

# Releasing your extension
Now that you have added the content/functionality you wanted its time to release the extension.

You should first make sure that any example content not being used is removed, you can do so either carefully by removing lines from the configs, or by removing a addon folder completely.
  * **Note that you can not remove the `core` addon.**

Next update the mod.cpp and meta.cpp files to contain the correct information for you (for steam release you can delete the meta.cpp from the build folder afterwards).

Now simply run the `Build` script in the root folder to build it and use the arma tools for signing and publishing the extension.
*(Note: it will not sign it for you, this needs to be done manually before publishing with `Arma 3 Tools` -> `DSUtils` & `Publisher`)*.
You can also distribute it in other ways other than the steam workshop simply by sending the build output to the users.

## Small disclaimer:

When you want other Antistasi players to easily find your extension, give it a descriptive name including the abbreviation `A3AE` like for example `A3AE - RHS Nato Template Overhaul`.
